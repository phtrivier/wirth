- Finally caved in, and extracted an (ugly) function that gets the 'current' token.
Normally, I now have what I need to parse an expression without loosing too much of my brain.
# Tue 2021-05-04 13:00-14:00
- Used uc-simulator in bin-simulator and bin-simulator-gui
- Added extra command line options and a dump of memory in the gui
Shuffling done, now on to parsing more things !
# Mon 2021-05-03 19:00-20:15
- Extracted uc-simulator and moved assembler tests to the right place
# Sat 2021-05-01 18:30-20:30
- Extracted binary crates and added arguments.
The whole chain of compiler -> simulate or assembler -> simulate now works...
# Fri 2021-04-30 17:30-18:00
- more code shuffling, but my arm hurts...
# Thu 2021-04-29 18:00-18:45
- Done part of the shuffling, but my head hurts and I'm loosing patience because of 
  passing Read / Write. At least that's something to learn !
# Thu 2021-04-29 13:00-14:00
- Yak-shaving thinking about code reorganisation... 
# Wed 2021-04-28 20:00-20:45
- Loaded generated binary code into cli-risc
Full loop is now done, but organisation needs to be cleaned up.
# Wed 2021-04-28 13:30-14:00
- Introduced some helper functions for tree
- Added possibility to parse ident := ident
# Tue 2021-04-27 18:00-20:00
- Introduced codegen for basic assignements to contants
# Mon 2021-04-26 12:30-13:30
- Updated example programs in cli-risc to computer-2017
- Added a MOD instruction because otherwise nothing was working
# Sun 2021-04-25 19:00-23:00

# Sun 2021-04-25 15:00-18:00
- Updated computer
# Sat 2021-04-24 19:00-23:00
