# Goal: Extract a function to get the 'current' token during parse

## Scanner / Parser

- [X] Change all types to allow this 'current' function
- [ ] Clarify that scan_next() just advances, and current() returns an Option
# Goal: Program that does basic arithmetic
## Parser
  - [ ] factor 
  - [ ] term
  - [ ] simple expression / expressions 
  - [ ] expression

## codegen
  - [ ] ADD and SUB and MUL and DIV

# Goal: Conditionnals

# Goal: Loops

# Goal: Variables 


# Goal: Procedures

# Goal: Module

# Goal: Types

# Goal: Improve code coverage
## Libraries
  - [ ] Just add more tests, maybe it's just acceptance tests missing...
## binaries
  - [ ] Extract functions to compute the arguments
  - [ ] Extract function that runs the main based on the arguments
  - [ ] Add integration test that reads simulated arguments and actually calls the lib.
  - [ ] Then simply exclude the "main" function from tarpaulin because it becomes irrelevant

# Goal: Druid simulator gui

# Goal: Literate Programming editor
