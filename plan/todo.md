# Goal: Improve code coverage
## Libraries
  - [ ] Just add more tests, maybe it's just acceptance tests missing...
## binaries
  - [ ] Extract functions to compute the arguments
  - [ ] Extract function that runs the main based on the arguments
  - [ ] Add integration test that reads simulated arguments and actually calls the lib.
  - [ ] Then simply exclude the "main" function from tarpaulin because it becomes irrelevant
