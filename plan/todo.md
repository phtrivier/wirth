# Goal: Loops

# Goal: Procedures

# Goal: Record types

# Goal: Array types

# Goal: Optimization

Rewrite the tree to avoid unnecessary computations, optimize things, etc...

# Goal: Improve code coverage
## Libraries
  - [ ] Just add more tests, maybe it's just acceptance tests missing...
## binaries
  - [ ] Extract functions to compute the arguments
  - [ ] Extract function that runs the main based on the arguments
  - [ ] Add integration test that reads simulated arguments and actually calls the lib.
  - [ ] Then simply exclude the "main" function from tarpaulin because it becomes irrelevant
