- STW instruction is not properly parsed in square.a (disp is read as 262146 instead of 2 !)
- There was an off-by-one error in parsing instruction addresses
* 2020-06-08
- assembler did not handle a displacement with an address in the future. This breaks the `square.a` example.
* 2020-06-06
- instruction encoding was wrong for F3 format and did not handle negative displacement right
- execution was not computing the address of the next instruction right ; moved to something closer to the book implementation

* Ongoing
- Error when executing a LDW instruction: ```
Instruction Memory { o: LDW, a: 4, b: 3, disp: 30 }
thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 4096 but the index is 32798', risc/src/computer.rs:159:36
