- My primes.a program was badly computing the address of a prime to load. Nice to notice that is
was the first error in an *assembly* program that I debugged with my simulator.
* 2020-06-11
- STW instruction is not properly parsed in square.a (disp is read as 262146 instead of 2 !)
- There was an off-by-one error in parsing instruction addresses
* 2020-06-08
- assembler did not handle a displacement with an address in the future. This breaks the `square.a` example.
* 2020-06-06
- instruction encoding was wrong for F3 format and did not handle negative displacement right
- execution was not computing the address of the next instruction right ; moved to something closer to the book implementation
* Ongoing
