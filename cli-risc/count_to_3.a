* A program that increments R0 until it's 3
*
* First part of the program simply defines constants that can be used afterwards.
#FOO    3               ; The number of iterations
* Than the main part of the program appears.
        MOVI R0,0,0     ; R0 <- 0
* `@xxx` symbols can be used as symbol for the corresponding memory position of the instruction
@LOOP   ADDI R0,R0,1    ; R0 <- R0 + 1
        CMPI R0,#FOO    ; Test if iteration is done
        BNE  @LOOP      ; Branch to absolute position
@END    RET  R14        ; Exits (assumes R14 is 0)
